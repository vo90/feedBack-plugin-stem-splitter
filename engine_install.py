"""Opt-in local-engine installer for the Stem Splitter plugin.

Nothing here runs on plugin load. It runs ONLY when the user clicks "Download
local engine + models" in the settings, which calls ``install_engine``. The
heavy libraries (torch, demucs / audio-separator, whisperx - multiple GB) are
pip-installed into ``{config_dir}/engine`` (the only writable path), and model
weights land in ``{config_dir}/models``. Both are added to ``sys.path`` / used
as cache dirs at run time by ``split_stems`` / ``transcribe``.

This keeps the guarantee: no model or dependency is ever downloaded unless the
user explicitly asks.
