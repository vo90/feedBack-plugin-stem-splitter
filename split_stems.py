"""Stem-separation orchestration for the Stem Splitter plugin.

Self-contained reimplementation of the concept the retired ``sloppak_convert``
module used to provide — built against feedBack's own pak I/O (``pak_io``) and
its ffmpeg helper (``lib/audio``). Three interchangeable engines behind one
interface:

* **remote** — POST the mix to ``{server_url}/separate`` (default model
  ``bs_roformer_sw``). No local deps.
* **audio-separator** (local, opt-in) — run ``bs_roformer_sw`` locally via the
  ``audio_separator`` package (parity with the remote server).
* **demucs** (local, opt-in) — run a demucs-native model (``htdemucs_6s``).

Local engines and their weights are only present after the user opts into the
in-app download (see ``engine_install``); this module never installs anything —
it imports lazily and raises a clear error if a local engine isn't available.
