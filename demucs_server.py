"""Managed local demucs server for the Stem Splitter plugin.

Downloads, installs, starts, stops and health-checks
`got-feedBack/feedBack-demucs-server` so a user can get a working split server
without touching a terminal.

Nothing here runs on plugin load, and nothing large is EVER downloaded implicitly:

* ``install_server()``  — only from the explicit "Install server" button (a few GB
  of wheels).
* ``prepare_models()``  — only from the explicit "Prepare models" button (the
  ~2 GB of model weights).
* ``start_server()``    — cheap. Warms up ONLY when the weights are already on
  disk (that's a RAM load, not a network pull); otherwise starts with
  ``--skip-warmup`` so launching can never trigger a big download.

Layout under ``{config_dir}/demucs-server/``::

    src/      server.py, run_demucs.py, run_roformer.py, requirements.txt, _launch.py
    pylibs/   the server's dependencies (pip --target)
    cache/    SLOPSMITH_DEMUCS_CACHE + TORCH_HOME + HF_HOME all point here, so the
              weights are ours to detect and ours to delete on uninstall (instead
              of being orphaned in ~/.cache).

**Why ``pip --target`` and not a venv.** The packaged app bundles its own Python,
and on Windows that is the python.org *embeddable* distribution, which ships **no
``venv`` and no ``ensurepip``** (see feedback-desktop/scripts/build-windows.sh -
it has to bootstrap pip with get-pip.py for exactly this reason). So
``python -m venv`` is guaranteed to fail on packaged Windows. ``pip install
--target`` needs neither module and works identically on Windows, macOS and Linux,
packaged or dev - it's the same approach the core plugin loader and this plugin's
own engine installer already use.

The deps still land in their own tree, isolated from the app's site-packages, and
the server is launched through a generated ``_launch.py`` that prepends that tree
to ``sys.path``. That in-process injection matters: packaged Windows runs in
isolated ``._pth`` mode where **PYTHONPATH is ignored**, so wiring the deps in via
the environment would silently not work.
